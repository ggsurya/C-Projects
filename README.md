## 📁 Projects Included

### 1. 🔢 Simple Calculator App

A basic calculator that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus calculations. It uses simple functions and conditional statements to handle different operations.

Key concepts: Using functions to organize code, applying conditionals to select operations, and utilizing math library functions for calculations.

Performs:
- Addition
- Subraction 
- Multiplication 
- Division  

**Concepts Used:** Arithmetical operations, conditionals(switch)

---

### 2. ❓ Number Guessing Game

A fun game where the computer picks a random number, and you try to guess it. After each guess, the game gives hints if your guess is too high or too low, and counts how many tries you take.

Key concepts: Using loops to repeat guesses, conditionals to check answers and give hints, and libraries for random number generation and timing.

Performs:
- Random number generation  
- User input with hints (higher/lower)  
- Tracks number of attempts  

**Concepts Used:** Loops, conditionals, `stdlib.h`, `time.h`

---

### 3. 🌡 Temperature Converter

A simple tool that converts temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. You enter a value and choose the conversion type, and it calculates the result.

Key concepts: Using functions to perform specific conversions and basic arithmetic operations for temperature calculations.

Performs:
- Converts between:
  - Celsius ↔ Fahrenheit
  - Celsius ↔ Kelvin  

**Concepts Used:** Functions, arithmetic operations

### 4. 📝 Mini To‑Do List Manager 

A straightforward task manager that lets you add tasks, see your full list, and delete tasks by their number. It helps keep track of what you need to do.

Key concepts: Using arrays to store tasks, loops to display and manage tasks, conditionals for menu options, and handling user input carefully.

Performs:
- Add new tasks  
- View all tasks  
- Delete specific tasks by number  

**Concepts Used:** Arrays, loops, conditionals, input handling

---

### 5. 🏦 Mini Bank Account Management System

A simple banking program where you can create accounts, deposit or withdraw money, and optionally save account details to a file so data isn’t lost.

Key concepts: Using structures to organize account data, functions to perform operations, validating inputs, and optionally reading/writing data with file handling.

Performs:
- Account creation (name, number, balance)  
- Deposit and withdrawal functionality  
- File handling for persistent data (optional)

**Concepts Used:** Structures, file I/O (optional), input validation, functions
