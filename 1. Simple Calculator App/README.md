# ðŸ”¢ Simple Calculator in C

A basic command-line calculator implemented in C that supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of two numbers.

## Features

- Accepts two floating-point numbers as input.
- Supports four basic arithmetic operations: addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), and division (`/`).
- Handles division by zero gracefully by displaying an error message.
- Provides formatted output with results rounded to two decimal places.
- User-friendly interface with clear prompts and result display.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the source code file.

2. Compile the program using a C compiler, for example:
   ```bash
   gcc -o calculator calculator.c
3. Run the executable:
   ```bash
   ./calculator
4. Follow the on-screen prompts to enter two numbers and an operator.
5. View the calculation result or error messages accordingly.

## Example

```
====================================
         Simple Calculator
====================================
Enter the 1st number     : 12.5
Enter the 2nd number     : 3.5
Enter the operator (+ - * /): *

------------- Result -------------
Multiplication : 12.50 * 3.50 = 43.75
====================================
```

## Error Handling

1. Division by zero attempts will display:
   ```bash
   Error          : Division by zero is not allowed.
2. Invalid operators will display:
   ```bash
   Error          : Invalid operator entered.
